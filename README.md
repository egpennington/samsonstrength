# Ladder Method Workout Timer
>‚ÄúTrain smarter with a ladder workout timer that runs offline, exports to PDF, and keeps you on pace.‚Äù

A minimalist **progressive ladder workout timer** built as a **PWA (Progressive Web App)**.  
Designed for strength and conditioning workouts that use ladder-style rep schemes (e.g., 1‚Üí10, 10‚Üí1, or 1‚ÜíN‚Üí1 pyramid).
